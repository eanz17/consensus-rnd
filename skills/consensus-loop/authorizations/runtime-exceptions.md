# Runtime Exception Authorization Mirror

This checked-in mirror preserves the durable authorization evidence for named
runtime exceptions whose original Phase 9 judge logs or maintainer directive
captures live under ignored `.refactor-loop/runs/` runtime output paths. It is
the only checked-in runtime authorization evidence mirror. It is not a runtime
API, loader, schema, or source of new authority. The executable contract remains
in `SKILL.md` and the tests.

## ControllerTopologyAuthority

- receipt_boundary: `published.json` is observed as a no-follow regular object and identified by SHA-256 of its exact bytes after exact-schema and verified-chain validation. Missing creation uses an exclusive same-directory link; only an exact valid PR/SHA binding is adoptable, while symlink, non-regular, malformed, replacement, or conflicting state fails closed and preserves retry state. Terminal provenance stores the exact-byte digest only after two agreeing reads, and terminal reentry requires equality with that stored digest. Receipt evidence grants no authority and remains subordinate to fresh #191 immediately before the receipt effect and terminal CAS.

- surface: `controller-private typed topology transactions`
- source_issue: `#2737`
- source_round: `r21`
- source_marker: `META_JUDGE_DONE:consensus:source-authoritative-owner-remediation`
- skill_anchor: `#controller-topology-authority`
- allowed: active-controller caller only; invoke exactly `create_compliant_worktree(CreateCompliantWorktreeRequest)`, `publish_exact_head(PublishExactHeadRequest)`, or `retire_superseded_pr(RetireSupersededPRRequest)` through the sole `ControllerTopologyAuthority`; create only `<type>/YYYY-MM-DD_<purpose>` at the exact admitted base; publish only independently authorized exact `F` with non-force exact-ref publication and remote equality proof; retire only the old PR after fresh OPEN/managed/base/link/exact commit-tree-diff/required-role replacement-head review proof and an idempotent sentinel record, and close only the old PR; read existing `refactor/iter<I>-<cluster>` only through `parse_legacy_implementation_head_evidence` as already-created migration evidence. The immutable create/publication phases are `CREATE_PREPARED -> WORKTREE_CREATED -> PUBLISH_PREPARED -> LOCAL_REF_READY -> REMOTE_REF_PUBLISHED -> PR_FINALIZED -> PUBLICATION_RECEIPT_FINALIZED`; the independent retirement phases are `RETIREMENT_PREPARED -> SUPERSESSION_POSTED -> OLD_PR_CLOSED`. Each transition rereads its complete live preproof, performs at most its named effect, proves the exact poststate, then obtains fresh #191 immediately before generation/digest CAS. Exact complete worktree, local ref, configured-remote ref, replacement PR, sentinel, and old-close no-op adoption uses the same reread-then-fresh-before-CAS rule. Denial, expiry, owner change, invalid/ambiguous evidence, remote lease read failure, lease CAS conflict, or provenance race leaves the prior durable phase and suppresses every later effect; retry starts with new live reads and a new gate.
- forbidden: no legacy writer, alias, dual-write, normalization, force rename, force push, semantic commit/content change, commit, amend, rebase, cherry-pick, merge, branch deletion, arbitrary ref update, Mapping topology helper, partial caller composition, public CLI, wakeup-plan action, daemon, host production SSOT, generic command/argv/args/shell/command_line/commands/env/git/gh/executor/refspec authority, PR merge, label mutation, replacement PR mutation/close, linked issue edit/close, or host-specific path/branch/SHA/identity.
- fact_source: complete frozen typed request; exact `publication:<branch>` or retirement provenance written only by `ControllerActions._topology_cas_provenance`; live worktree registry, independent commit/tree/`final_diff_digest`, configured refs, receipt, issue state, managed PR equivalence, required-role live-head review, and immutable-`sentinel_digest` tuple-filtered comment reads. Issue managed membership is caller admission only. Every terminal return fully rereads live facts; a stored sentinel URL requires exactly one matching rediscovery.
- verification: `test_controller_topology_authority.py`, `test_runtime_exception_authorization_sources.py`, `test_skill_entrypoint_contract.py`
- no_new_runtime_authority: This mirror authorizes only the three closed typed transactions through their sole owner. It creates no command bus, lifecycle actor, generic git/GitHub port, public command, wakeup action, or daemon authority.

## ConsensusGateProof(per #579)

- surface: `controller-private ConsensusGateProof`
- source_issue: `#579`
- source_round: `r2`
- source_marker: `META_JUDGE_DONE:consensus:minimal:ConsensusGateProof pure validator/anchor first, no same-round wakeup/effect runtime migration`
- skill_anchor: `#consensus-gate-proof`
- allowed: validate proof validity for substantive decision targets only with non-mechanical `target_kind`, stable `target_ref`, `target_digest`, `decision_producer_id`, `evidence[]` entries containing `producer_id`, `role`, `artifact`, `artifact_digest`, and `verdict`, `required_roles`, `verdict_rule`, and optional repo-relative `scope_paths`; reject single-worker self-certification, target digest mismatch, target kind/ref mismatch, artifact digest mismatch, missing required roles, duplicate roles, duplicate or overlapping producers, unsupported verdict rules, mechanical target kinds, missing required `scope_paths`, and recursive lifecycle or command fields; consuming helpers may use valid proof only as an admission fact and must still revalidate durable target digest, artifact digests, #191 owner, live state, and helper-specific preconditions.
- forbidden: no GitHub/git/file lifecycle authority, no route/post/label/spawn/merge/apply side effects, no public CLI, no wakeup-plan action projection, no wakeup-runner action, no IssueDecompositionPlan apply migration in this issue, no standalone wakeup-plan action projection, no standalone wakeup-runner action, no recursive gate for mechanical route/post/label/spawn/merge/apply-validated-proof actions, no proof-ticket/resume system, no command bus, and no `cmd`, `argv`, `shell`, `command_line`, `commands`, `env`, `git`, `gh`, `executor`, `lifecycle_authority`, `lifecycle_owner`, `args`, `controller_action`, `proof_ticket`, or `resume_ticket` fields.
- fact_source: proof JSON supplied by a helper integration plus the target artifact digest and artifact digests passed by that helper; the validator does not read GitHub, git, host.env, `.refactor-loop/` runtime ledgers, prompt bodies, or local process state.
- verification: `test_consensus_gate.py`, `test_runtime_exception_authorization_sources.py`, `test_skill_reference_anchors.py`
- no_new_runtime_authority: This mirror documents a controller-private pure validator only. Proof validity never grants lifecycle authority; later route/post/label/spawn/merge/apply-validated-proof integrations must add their own consensus, #191 active-controller owner gate, live state, and helper-specific preconditions.

- forbidden_boundary: no daemon direct `nohup spawn-codex`, no daemon executable command surface, no argv array, no shell command, no generic command bus, no issue/PR lifecycle, label lifecycle, commit, push, merge, tag, release, prompt-body decision, host fact invention, generic lifecycle actor, or authority outside the controller/actor-enqueued dispatch queue.

- affected_contracts: #626 deletes recurring per-worker progress comments; `SKILL.md` keeps only the source-time `TEST_NO_LOOP` test seam and #504 fixed global status-card PATCH.
- allowed_directive: obsolete historical evidence only; it grants no recurring daemon delete path, no per-worker progress comment create/edit/delete/get/read path, and no own-comment maintenance authority.
- forbidden_boundary: no GitHub progress comment delete retry, no GitHub cleanup of existing spam through this runtime path, no per-worker issue/PR comment create/edit/read/delete, no production use of `TEST_NO_LOOP`, no new queue, lifecycle authority, host fact source, issue/PR lifecycle, label lifecycle, commit, push, merge, tag, or release authority.

- allowed_directive: when codex-floor deficit exists, satisfy open managed issue/PR next-step work without in-flight coverage for its current phase before dispatching fresh audit; route design-solving, reviewing, fixing, implementing, pr-open, and consensus-reached work before ordinary audit fallback.
- forbidden_boundary: no spawning fresh audit while existing design-solving/fixing/reviewing/implementing/pr-open/consensus-reached managed work has zero matching in-flight codex; no backlog-increasing audit as a substitute for actionable existing work; no issue/PR lifecycle, label lifecycle, commit, push, merge, tag, release, or generic lifecycle actor.
- verification: `test_wakeup_plan.py`, `test_skill_entrypoint_contract.py`, `test_runtime_exception_authorization_sources.py`

- forbidden_boundary: no treating a current-looking phase label, prior marker, or "awaiting" comment as an exemption; stale `updatedAt` is routing metadata only and does not authorize GitHub comments, label edits, PR merges, issue closes, takeover, issue/PR lifecycle, commit, push, merge, tag, release, or generic lifecycle actor outside existing gates.
- verification: `test_wakeup_plan.py`, `test_skill_entrypoint_contract.py`, `test_runtime_exception_authorization_sources.py`

- allowed_directive: when `deficit>0`, emit/obey hard gate for legal dispatchable real work first; dispatch ordinary audit fallback when no actionable existing work exists and no same-iteration audit is active; when same-iteration audit is already active, expose blocked deficit with `dispatch_required=0`, `reason=single_active_audit_in_flight`, and `blocked_deficit=N`, and do not duplicate audit. `AUDIT_DONE:none:0` still does not exempt the floor.
- forbidden_boundary: no general low-floor exemption, no duplicate same-iteration audit, no fabricated work, no AuditLaneIdentity, no `AUDIT_LANE_ID`, no `audit-iter-N-laneK`, no lane/shard protocol in this issue, no ending a wakeup with positive deficit except the visible `WAIT:single-active-audit` blocked boundary, no issue/PR lifecycle, label lifecycle, commit, push, merge, tag, release, or generic lifecycle actor.

- forbidden_boundary: no parallel milestone state file, queue, marker, local cache, or work-unit field; no killing already-running non-milestone codex solely because milestone became active; no phase/human semantics change; no issue/PR lifecycle, label lifecycle, commit, push, merge, tag, release, or generic lifecycle actor.

The label is not standalone authorization, not a generic resume ticket, not a public CLI/lifecycle actor, and not authority for issue/PR close/reopen/body/title/merge/tag/release actions. `dispatch_consensus_implementation` only moves the issue to implementing phase, creates the canonical implementation worktree/head, renders the implement prompt, and spawns the implement worker; it does not commit, push, or open a PR; after validating a real scoped diff, committing it, and restoring the integration base, `publish_verification.py` is the unique helper-private publish verification job/receipt owner: parent ticks write immutable `request.json`, pin `refs/consensus/publish/<job_key>`, start at most one `consensus-rnd-cli publish-verification-worker <job_dir>` helper-private child when a slot is free, and return without waiting. The child runs only host-owned `BUILD_CMD`/`TEST_CMD` and writes verification evidence/logs by atomically updating `result.json`; only a `VERIFIED` receipt whose `job_key`, verified SHA, `gate_id`, checkpoint hashes, `EXIT=0` evidence, private ref OID, and not-superseded target revalidate may enter finalization. Finalization passes the literal verified object id and retryable `VERIFIED` receipt to owner-private `ControllerTopologyAuthority.publish_exact_head`; that complete transaction owns exact local-ref creation, non-force configured-remote publication, canonical PR create/update/adoption, receipt finalization, and terminal provenance. Newer SHA or gate id supersedes old unpublished jobs; per-job retry state is `RETRY_WAIT` for 30min, then 2h, then 8h, then `QUARANTINED`, reset by candidate SHA or gate id change. `publish_verification.py` remains the only verification fact source: no `publish_ratchet.py`, no new long-lived daemon, no public lifecycle CLI, no generic command executor, no GitHub/git lifecycle, no issue/PR/label/tag/release authority, no host production SSOT authority, and no second verification fact source. An existing canonical PR is never standalone completion authority: exact PR adoption or an authorized core-identical title/body update proceeds only inside `publish_exact_head`, reaches `PUBLICATION_RECEIPT_FINALIZED`, and only then permits separate reviewer dispatch. `wakeup-plan` binds durable topology identity and the sole eligible legacy PR as read-only evidence; missing, duplicate, foreign, unmanaged, head/base/link-mismatched, or malformed evidence fails closed/status-only, and stale-base clean output fails closed/status-only; `wakeup-plan` action `head_sha` is not reviewer-head authority; local `.refactor-loop/runs/review-pr<N>-<role>-r<R>.md` and `.refactor-loop/logs/review-pr<N>-<role>-r<R>.log` files are diagnostics, prompt inputs, completion/pending hints, and stale redispatch hints only, not merge/fix lifecycle authority; supervisor-refreshed log mtime and matching same-device spawn holder PID feed `reviewer_liveness.py` pending/terminal/redispatchable facts only; raw PR-head check buckets or advisory check buckets are display-only diagnostics, not merge/fix lifecycle authority; mechanically call existing controller helpers or #396 narrow helpers for spawn codex, including allowlisted `release-rollup-body` generation that only writes `.refactor-loop/runs/release-rollup-pr-body.md`, named helper `dispatch_consensus_implementation`, named helper `publish_implementation_output`, named helper `archive_invalid_harness_spawn_intent` that only appends a local invalid-intent digest archive marker, named helper `apply_issue_decomposition_plan`, named helper `apply_default_issue_intake_claim`, then named helper `open_release_rollup_pr_from_action` after the body exists, publish worker output, dispatch reviewers/fix/remote-ci worker only for target-required failed checks with `target_required_checks_red`, apply triage decision, merge PR under review truth table plus target-required readiness, close managed item from drop marker, and publish release through #322.
- false_positive_consensus_defer: `wakeup-plan` may project named helper `defer_false_positive_consensus` only from a clean consensus marker plus durable judge artifact identity, normalized `scope_paths: none`, no-change/false-positive framing, and live OPEN managed design-solving issue; runner revalidates those facts before calling the helper, and the helper only posts the fixed explanation and transitions labels to `crnd:phase:blocked` plus `crnd:human:auto`; non-empty `scope_paths` consensus remains implementation-bearing through `dispatch_consensus_implementation`.
- forbidden: no arbitrary git/gh command, workflow tag/release, router guard adjudication, generic codex fallback, label/merge/close outside existing helper or named #396 helper, prompt-body decision, standalone authorization from `wakeup-plan`, no generic effect-adapter runtime abstraction, no public command bus, no executor layer; the fixed forbidden field set is at least `cmd`, `argv`, `shell`, `command_line`, `commands`, `env`, `git`, `gh`, `executor`, `lifecycle_authority`, and `lifecycle_owner`, with existing extra `args` rejection retained; no generic command fields, new lifecycle authority, `ControllerTurnDecision`, controller-turn worker, private schema, active-active scheduler, `.refactor-loop/host.env` as host production SSOT, or generic lifecycle actor.
- fact_source: `wakeup-plan` closed action projection is the only action projection fact source but not a standalone authorization source; `reviewer_liveness.py` is the owner-local local reviewer pending/terminal/redispatchable fact source only for duplicate-dispatch suppression and stale recovery hints, not final side-effect authorization; safe-progress classification is the owner-local risk admission fact source only for low/medium/high routing, not final side-effect authorization; action `head_sha` cannot substitute for reviewer-head authority; final side-effect permit comes from #191 active-controller owner plus source marker/artifact, GitHub-visible final-sentinel same-head reviewer comments satisfying the review truth table, target branch required-check facts plus live PR head check-runs classified into target-required and advisory buckets, live GitHub state, release #322 preflight, or helper-specific validator.

<!-- Refactor (issue-298): Old: mirror covered only write-side restart helper health semantics. New: mirror adds read-only daemon-status projection over the same facts while write repair/reload remains restart-daemons. -->
- allowed: restart helper owns singleton wrappers, actor-owned heartbeat leases, actor-held open `fcntl.flock` singleton locks at `.refactor-loop/locks/<daemon>.singleton.lock`, helper-private launch fingerprints at `.refactor-loop/locks/<daemon>.fingerprint.json`, and helper-private `DaemonProcessInventory` for the existing static daemon allowlist; each wrapper may self-heal only its own static-allowlist child on child exit or actor heartbeat failure by reading the actor-owned heartbeat, logging one reason line, terminating that child with SIGTERM/grace/SIGKILL when needed, and restarting the same resolved command after at least one wrapper poll interval. `restart-daemons` requires host-owned `CONSENSUS_RND_HOST_ENV` base admission before `_prepare_dirs()`, active-controller status writes, RuntimeRetention, daemon launch, update-check, and direct `start_daemon()`: explicit locator, non-empty parsed host.env, host.env `REPO_ROOT` matching the loaded repository, and valid `GH_REPO_SLUG`; `MAINTAINER_WHITELIST` is not a fleet-wide restart gate and stays comment-monitor-local. Malformed/future actor heartbeat fails closed immediately; missing/stale numeric heartbeat is measured against the current child generation spawn age and may terminate/restart only after one heartbeat freshness window. `DaemonProgressBudget` comes from restart-managed `DaemonRuntimePolicy`: completed ticks stay fresh through resolved tick interval plus restart progress grace; begin ticks use only restart progress grace; `daemon-status` and `restart-daemons` use the same budget helper, and missing/malformed/fail/true overdue progress fails closed even when heartbeat is fresh. `DaemonRuntimePolicy` only mirrors `restart.py::DAEMON_COMMANDS` target cadence and is not a daemon registry, lifecycle authority, host production SSOT, or #191 lease substitute. A launched daemon actor may write compact JSON singleton metadata in field order `daemon_name`, `repo_root`, `actor_pid`, `heartbeat_file`, `fingerprint_file`, `command_sha256`, `started_at`, `lock_generation`; `repo_root` and path fields are repo-symbolic `$REPO_ROOT` / `$REPO_ROOT/...` diagnostics only, not absolute host paths. The live open file lock is the mutual-exclusion fact source; the file body is diagnostic metadata only. Wrappers do not write heartbeat and do not reload fingerprint, singleton metadata, or host.env. the controller's periodic wakeup is the primary supervisor that invokes restart-daemons, and cron/launchd is an optional outer keepalive only for unattended operation with no controller session covering wrapper death, boot/post-wake, fingerprint/host.env reload, duplicate cleanup, and #191 owner refresh. pid alive plus fresh heartbeat plus current fingerprint plus held valid singleton lock by the live managed child plus zero duplicate canonical live wrapper for the same repo_root plus daemon name plus restart wrapper shape plus same resolved static allowlist command is the only skip condition; missing, malformed, or mismatched fingerprint data fails closed, held-malformed singleton lock skips termination and launch, and missing/malformed/mismatch fingerprint data or duplicate canonical wrappers fail closed to reap every same-repo same-daemon wrapper before one fresh restart; free singleton metadata is diagnostic only and does not block restart; missing singleton locks keep old pid/heartbeat/fingerprint facts readable; malformed unlocked singleton files are not holder evidence; runs canonical RuntimeRetention before daemon freshness checks. `comment-monitor` startup fail-close for missing `GH_REPO_SLUG` or `MAINTAINER_WHITELIST` after trusted context load appends one grep-able pending-event line `DAEMON_STARTUP_FAIL_CLOSED daemon=comment-monitor reason=<field>-unset` and then exits without GitHub/git/lifecycle authority. `consensus-rnd-cli daemon-status --json` is a read-only daemon-status projection over the same static allowlist, pid/heartbeat/fingerprint readers, cached active-controller status, `DaemonProcessInventory`, singleton lock projection, and split progress budget helper, including stale reason/age, duplicate count, progress fields, and the parsed fields `singleton_lock_path`, `singleton_lock_state`, `singleton_lock_holder_pid`, `singleton_lock_metadata_valid`, and `singleton_lock_reason`; repair/reload remains restart-daemons.

Each migrated handler has a supervisor-local `TickHandlerContract` naming only handler identity, required projection sources/freshness, delegated existing helper, replaced legacy daemon target, and net-deletion target. Handler `backoff`, `blocked`, and `noop` results are returned and logged as diagnostics only. `$CONTROLLER_TICK_SUPERVISOR_ENABLE=true` is a first migration opt-in that lets `restart-daemons` include the supervisor target, mechanically excludes the migrated `comment-monitor` legacy daemon target from active restart inventory, and keep the canonical legacy daemon list as the static compatibility list. The `comment-monitor` handler delegates to existing `run_comment_monitor_reconcile_tick()` / `CommentMonitor.tick()` and requires fresh `managed_work_snapshot` before executing.

phase9-router must not read the process table or spawn-task locks as dispatch predicates, because same-device duplicate execution is handled only by `TaskSpawnClaimStore.acquire(...)` at the `spawn-codex` boundary using the same log-derived task id held-claim skip/noop; write router prompts, append `HARNESS_SPAWN_INTENT` with `command: "spawn-codex"` as a closed semantic enum, and append the private dispatch ledger with `dispatch_state="harness-intent"` only for the five built-in phase9 direct routes: DesignConsensusIssueIntake queues each r1 solver role (`minimal`, `structural`, `delete`) whose role-specific ledger key, r1 evidence/log, and validated pending target intent are absent as that role's r1 `HARNESS_SPAWN_INTENT`, and existing evidence/log/pending intent for one solver role suppresses only that role;

- skill_anchor: `#rollup-autonomous-merge-2026-06-06`
- allowed: active-controller owner only; detect and maintain exactly one open rollup PR whose head starts with `rollup/` and base is `$REVIEW_BASE_BRANCH`; when one exists, update only that rollup head with `git push --force-with-lease origin <integration_sha>:refs/heads/<existing-rollup-head>` and refresh title/body; create a new rollup PR only when no open rollup exists; exclude rollup PRs from reviewer dispatch, review-fix, and remote-ci-fix; project only `auto_merge_release_rollup_pr_from_action`; re-read live PR base/head/head SHA; verify `$ROLLUP_AUTO_MERGE` is auto/true-like; verify exact live head SHA required checks through `ReleaseRequiredChecksProjection`; then run only `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch`.
- forbidden: no cluster PR review policy change, no reviewer bypass for non-rollup PRs, no generic merge-to-review-base authority, no direct push to `$REVIEW_BASE_BRANCH`, no force-push except singleton rollup head update, no admin merge, no branch-protection bypass, no issue lifecycle, no label mutation, no tag/release, no #322 release publication change, no public lifecycle CLI, no generic lifecycle actor, no worker-owned commit/push/merge.
- fact_source: maintainer directive artifact plus host env surface matrix for `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH`, `$REVIEW_BASE_BRANCH`, `$ROLLUP_AUTO_MERGE`, and `$HOST_GITHUB_RELEASE_REQUIRED_CHECKS`; live GitHub PR view for base/head/head SHA; Checks API projection for exact-SHA required checks.
- fail_closed: missing/invalid branch config, non-rollup head, wrong base, stale action head, missing required checks, pending/red/missing/API-failed checks, invalid `$ROLLUP_AUTO_MERGE`, or branch-protection/host-policy merge failure writes a grepable pending event and leaves the PR for humans.
- verification: `test_sync_dev.py`, `test_controller_actions.py`, `test_wakeup_plan.py`, `test_wakeup_runner.py`, `test_host_env_surface_matrix.py`, `test_runtime_exception_authorization_sources.py`, `test_skill_reference_anchors.py`
- no_new_runtime_authority: This mirror grants only singleton rollup head maintenance and CI-green squash merge for `rollup/` PRs into `$REVIEW_BASE_BRANCH`; it does not authorize generic merge, release publication, review-gate bypass outside rollups, or any public lifecycle command.

## Temporary issue #2737 partial decomposition recovery

- source_kind: consensus-approved disposable two-key capability under #403
- authority_split: reviewed capability code exclusively owns the closed mutation algebra and occurrence-file changed-path rule; a separate immutable occurrence record exclusively owns incident, prefix-zero baseline, PR binding, expiry, and cleanup facts; existing live projections exclusively own mutable review/check/merge/lease/actor/item/target/#403 facts
- admission: both keys, two equal complete bindings, an empty conflict-free canonical `IssueDecompositionApplyProjection`, fresh #191 ownership, actor/repository/item admission, and an immediate complete revalidation are mandatory before each at-most-one effect
- recovery: public target state is the only completion evidence; every ambiguous transport result immediately triggers one fresh complete exact-prefix read, only the exact next prefix adopts the effect, and unchanged, duplicate, interleaved, skipped, unavailable, edited, reacted, reopened, or otherwise drifting state blocks before another effect without retry loops or compensation
- forbidden_boundary: neither key is standalone authority; no occurrence fallback, baseline in capability code, mutable live facts in either key, receipt/ticket/ledger/write-back, public CLI, daemon, wakeup action, host flag, generic executor, incident framework, compatibility wrapper, rollback, or alternate mutation site
- removal: after terminal state is independently proven twice with all gates rerun and zero writes, a separately reviewed cleanup must exactly subtract the frozen PR-A ownership closure and occurrence record; it adds, moves, renames, and copies nothing, exactly reverses every bounded shared owner, restores frozen base bytes, and leaves only the reviewed generic #403 projection/execution behavior and tests; the retained test-only cleanup contract verifies exact changed paths and bytes plus absent incident imports/routes without owning runtime authority or acting as a generic registry
- verification: deterministic decomposition projection/execution equivalence, canonical record rejection, independent literal transport transcripts, singleton changed-path agreement, binding/freshness/prefix/response-loss matrices, route absence, authorization/source guards, and the complete skill suite
